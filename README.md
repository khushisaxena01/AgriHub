This platform addresses the critical environmental challenge of stubble burning by connecting farmers with sustainable alternatives through a data-driven approach. By integrating farmer data, agricultural science, and government resources, we create personalized recommendations for stubble management while incentivizing adoption through a rewards system. The solution simultaneously improves soil health, reduces air pollution, provides economic benefits to farmers, and gives policymakers actionable insights on intervention effectiveness. Our holistic approach transforms agricultural waste from an environmental problem into a resource opportunity while supporting rural digitalization.
